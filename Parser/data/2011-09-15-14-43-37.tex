Apparently, I am not the only exchange student @ KAIST that is blogging. For more reading pleasure, here I introduce my other blogging friends. However, most of them blog in their native language, so just use \sout{the force} Google Translate.

\begin{itemize*}
	\item \textbf{Karin:} http://seoulong.wordpress.com/ (in Swedish)
	\item \textbf{Ada:} http://jeonhwon.blogspot.com/ (in Chinese
	\item \textbf{Thomas:} http://koreasdiary.blogspot.com/ (in English)
\end{itemize*}

Enjoy!
