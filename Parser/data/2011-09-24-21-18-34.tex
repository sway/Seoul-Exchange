No, wait, sorry, it's still summer...the weather is going quite crazy. Long pants, short pants, sweatshirt, t-shirt, shirt, you never know what to wear. I was quite happy that the we finally got the real autumn weather, when t-shirt is still OK but sweatshirt is fine as well, however, today the weather proved me wrong, because it is around 25°C again. Well, that does not really help me not feel sick



Apart from the crazy weather, the school is getting more and more intense as well. Assignments, presentations, here we go. On top of that, I still have to finish our report from Kenya (duh!) and work on a project for one course in Delft. And have fun, right:) Talking about schoolwork. Almost every course has some group project associated to it, which is quite similar to Delft. The only difference is, that the groups here are usually selected by teachers, so you can't really influence the team composition. For increased variety and "multiculturality" exchange students are in most cases assigned to different groups, which is fine, because you at least get the chance to see how Korean groupwork works (?). And that is the problem. Why? Let me explain something about Korea first.



The Korean culture is very much based on hierarchy and status. Are you older? You are superior. Do you have a better job than me? You are superior. Are you a young foreign student? Go screw yourself. Ok, that is a little exaggerated. The point is that the group dynamics are soooo different compared to Europe, and The Netherlands in particular. Over there, all the group members are equal. You have something to say? Then go for it. If it's crap we will tell you, never mind. All the little fights inside the group are expected and even induced, because they lead to a better result. In Korea, however, the discussion is much more "civilized". Everybody is so respectful, that they are not able to criticize other's ideas. Every idea is good, only some are better. And every idea has to be approved by the eldest person in the group, otherwise it is not considered acceptable. I find this rather annoying, because I am used to "say stuff". Throwing ideas, comments, feedback, criticism at others, and letting them do the same. Here it is not possible. Not only that criticizing older people is not acceptable, but since I am usually the youngest in the group, no one expects me to do so.



I know that now you might think how unadaptable I am, but it is really hard to switch to a completely different behavior. I am trying, trust me. Thinking twice before saying something and trying to obey the rules they have. I am in fact happy about this experience. I think it will really help me in dealing with people, because until now, I always had the advantage of the home environment and this is the second time (after Kenya) I am an alien in a completely different cultural environment.



And in Korea I am literally an Alien — I have finally received my Alien Registration Card, which is quite essential if you want to do something here. Not only you need it to open a bank account or to get a mobile phone, but it also serves as a multientry visa, so you don't have to pay additional $50 when you want to go to China or Japan and then come back.



Since I was sick and I had stuff to do, last week was quite dull. The highlight was Mark's B-Day party, which started with a pre-game at the 7th floor (soju + beer) and then continued in Hongdae in Cocoon. It was fun, even though some people suffered from a premature ending and went back to the dorms before we reached the club. I managed to retain my sobriety, so the morning was pretty acceptable.

However, I hope that the true highlight, the summit, the peak, the apex of this week is still ahead, because tomorrow, my friends, tomorrow we are going to conquer the LOTTE WORLD!
