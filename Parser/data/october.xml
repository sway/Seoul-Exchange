		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last time I have been to a baseball match was two years ago, when Kotlářka played at Markéta. And that was only as a spectator. I don't even remember the exact date of my last game as a player — I only remember it was the final game of the 2004 Czech championship, where we played against Krč, and despite our underdog position, we managed to keep up until around 7th inning. We lost, unfortunately, but for me the silver medal was nearly asy valuable as the gold one from the previous year, because we had a "weaker" team. Hmm, I think I got carried away a little.

Anyway, me and other intl students from KAIST decided to go see baseball game at the Jamsil Stadium. You might not know that, but baseball is one of the most favorite sports here. The professional league comprises 8 teams, and since now it's geting into its post-season phase, it is one of the hottest topics among sports fans in Korea.

[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2QQGeGBBmM]

We went to see a derby between Doosan Bears and LG Twins. The teams in KBO league are named after a sponsor instead of a city, and they sometimes take inspiration from the MLB (Twins, Lotte Giants, Kia Tigers). This two teams don't stand a chance getting into the post-season, so it was merely a game of honor for them, because both come from Itaewon and both have the Jamsil Stadium as their home ball park. Because the Bears part of the stadium was already sold out long before the game, we had to get seats in Twins' section. As it turned out later, that was the only glitch of the game.

Baseball in Korea is not only a sport, but also a show. People come to watch the game and have a tremendous amount of fun as well. Each team has own cheerleaders and a entertainer, that tells people what to do. Since everybody has cheering stick, the stands turn into a sea of red/white/... every time people go crazy. It's impressive. Moreover, every player (or almost every player) has it's own song that is played through the PA when he's at bat, and of course, all the people know these songs, so with every new player the stadium (or at least half of it) turns into a huge karaoke. Every good action leads to another wave of craziness, even if it's just a single hit. You can't even imagine what happens when someone scores a homerun.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Doosan Fans with white cheering sticks"]<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6202711634_cc4303753c.jpg" alt="Doosan Fans" width="500" height="333" />[/caption]

As I said, our location was not perfect. From unknown reasons the Twins fans are not as crazy as the ones of Bears, so our side of the stadium was rather lame. This was also caused by the development of the game, because even though the teams were tied in second, from fourth on Bears started kicking Twins' ass. The main reason were the Twins' pitchers, giving BBs and serving nice hitting material to Doosan hitters. I was quite surprised by the eventual humiliation (9:1), because Bears are the second to last team while Twins are 5th, the first team not to go to the play-offs.

Despite the loss, I have enjoyed the match so much. Watching nice baseball after so may years really brought back my baseball memories. I will definitely go to see another match during play-offs, because even though the quality is not as high as in the MLB, it is definitely worth seeing.

Here are some pictures I took that day. In the morning I was in Gangnam, where I had a meeting with my Delft classmate Ferdian about one project so some photos are from there.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[NRB stands for Norebang (노래방), which is a combination of song (노래) and room (방). So, who knows what a song room is? You? Or you? Nobody? OK, I'll tell you...it's KARAOKE!

On one September night we have decided to go for some karaoke. South Korea is, as almost all Asian countries, crazy about karaoke. There is about 35000 Norebangs in Korea, and they are a integral part of South Korean culture. A typical evening might start with a Korean BBQ with lots of Soju, then a bar with some "Soju and hof" (basically soju and beer) and when everybody is drunk and nearly unconscious, they go to a Norebang to sober up and have some fun. We chose the more direct way — from our dorm directly to the norebang. Even though our campus is located in not that cool part of Seoul, there are about 6 karaoke places within the walking distance, which is awesome. We were quite a big group (cca. 15 people), so it was guaranteed that we will have a good time. And we indeed had.

[caption id="attachment_192" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="How to start..."]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/nrb/attachment/01/" rel="attachment wp-att-192"><img class="size-full wp-image-192 " title="How to start..." src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/01.jpg" alt="" width="530" /></a>[/caption]

The karaoke room was quite "normal" — sofa, table, TV, speakers, remote control. And 3 books with songs in English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Russian and quite a few other languages.

At the beginning, when everybody was sober, nobody wanted to sing. That is understandable, though, since we did not know each other that well and embarrasing yourself in front of other people requires either big balls or big bowls of alcohol. We chose the second way, so we started ordering beers and soju to get the party started. If I remember correctly, the first volunteer was Simone or Mario, however, soon after the first performance everybody got into the right mood and the hell has broken loose.

[caption id="attachment_195" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="Hogging the mic, again..."]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/nrb/attachment/04/" rel="attachment wp-att-195"><img class="size-full wp-image-195 " title="Hogging the mic, again..." src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/04.jpg" alt="" width="530" /></a>[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_194" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="My air guitar solo...with a lot of feeeeeeeliiiiiiiing..."]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/nrb/attachment/03/" rel="attachment wp-att-194"><img class="size-full wp-image-194 " title="My air guitar solo...with a lot of feeeeeeeliiiiiiiing..." src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/03.jpg" alt="" width="530" /></a>[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_199" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="Guess the song..."]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/nrb/attachment/08/" rel="attachment wp-att-199"><img class="size-full wp-image-199 " title="Guess the song..." src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/08.jpg" alt="" width="530" /></a>[/caption]

We planned to spend around 2 hours there. We ended up singing for 4 hours straight, before our vocal cords gave up and turned us into a group of whispering rockstars. During the evening, we went through all the "classics" such as Queen, The Grease, ABBA, U2 or Backstreet Boys ("I Want It That Way" by Mark and me was simply the best performance of the evening.), as well as some contemporary crap such as Justin Bieber (<em>"Baby, Baby, Baby, Oooooooh!"</em>), Wiz Khalifa or Justin Timberlake. We also drank a ridiculous amount of beer and soju, but that's just what you do.

[caption id="attachment_197" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="Flawless victory"]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/nrb/attachment/06/" rel="attachment wp-att-197"><img class="size-full wp-image-197 " title="Flawless victory" src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/06.jpg" alt="" width="530" /></a>[/caption]

At 2am we finally finished, partly because we were tired and partly because there was no more beer in the place. Yes, we drank it all. Each of us paid 20,000KRW (12EUR), which is fairly cheap for the amount of fun (and alcohol) we had, and went home or to the Burger King for a little snack. The next day I was barely able to speak, but it was definitely worth it, because:
<blockquote>Am I your fire,
your one desire,
believe when I say,
I want it that way</blockquote>

Btw. pictures are stolen from Marc, because he was the only one taking pictures, as far as I know. Thanks, man!:)]]></content:encoded>

Take a break
<span style="direction:ltr;">Fireworks
Boom bang bang!</span></blockquote>
<em>I couldn't resist to put this little pop-culture reference here, even though I doubt that someone will recognize it:)</em>

On Saturday we went to see the annual Seoul International Fireworks Festival, that took place in the Yeouido Hangang Park, at the bank of the Han river. It is a one day event, organized by a explosives company called Hanwha, and this year there were teams from Korea, Japan and Portugal showing their fireworks skills.

Our Korean friends told us that it is going to be crowded. And they were right. When we saw the masses of people in the subway we realized that leaving the dorm at 6pm was maybe a little too late, considering that the first show was scheduled for 7:30pm. After getting to the subway line 5, we quickly found out that "crowded" was a mere underestimation of the situation. Everybody in Seoul went to see the fireworks. Or at least it seemed so.

[caption id="attachment_217" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="The whole population of Seoul gathered at one subway station"]<a href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/we-didnt-start-the-fire/p1000693/" rel="attachment wp-att-217"><img class="size-medium wp-image-217" title="The whole population of Seoul gathered at one subway station" src="http://soulexchange.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/p1000693.jpg?w=550" alt="" width="550" height="218" /></a>[/caption]

Inside of the trains it was like a frotteur's dream. As more and more people were pouring in at each station, it was getting more and more uncomfortable, with people pushing from all sides, trying to get through. This crowd had one advantage, though. Since we were not sure where to get off the train, we simply waited until the sea of people washed us out. At the station the situation repeated — people, people, people. Fortunately, Koreans have anticipated this situation, so the vestibule was full of people in reflective vests with shining <del>cheering</del> sticks, that were managing the crowd, trying to distribute the mass of human bodies equally between the subway exits. And honestly, they managed quite well. We were still moving forward, without unnecessary waiting.

The situation outside was fortunately better — some streets were closed for traffic, so there was enough space for all the people to spread out. Soon after we left the subway, the first show started, so we just found some place where we could see the sky and watched the fireworks. I don't know if it was the Japanese one or the Portuguese, though. After the first one we moved to the bridge, close to which was the pier the fireworks was launched from. The police was trying to keep the traffic going, however, since only one line was open and there were people running across the bridge all the time, it was quite difficult. Later on we managed to get across the bridge, which really gave us nice view on the fireworks. I tried to take some pictures, however, it would require a tripod and a SLR to make it look awesome. So it is just nice...

The problem was that there was still a lot of people, so when we came to the subway station, the entrance was simply closed and guarded by police and subway officials. To prevent overcrowding of the subway, they let people in only when there was enough space. They also distributed people between the different entrances, so none would get clogged. Well, it worked quite well. I have to admit, Koreans are so orderly and well organized!</span></p>

The ride back was one of the moments when you just wish you were home, because you are tired and the subway is packed and everything is annoying etc. But we made it, and the final walk from Hoegi, with a short stop for a "meat on the stick" was a nice ending to a tiring afternoon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>"Thunder and lightning, not so frightening, anymore..."</em>

After several nice days the hell has broken loose in here. The rain was so heavy that only going from the dorm to the SUPEX building made me <del>wet</del> completely soaked. I have a feeling that it might have something to do with my non-existent umbrella, but that's just me. Me and Marc were planning to go to Lotte Dept. Store, because he needed some clothes and I need some shoes, since my beloved Nike's gave up and fell apart. Since we are no wusses, we decided to walk to the subway station, despite the thunderstorm and rain, so I only had to stop at 7eleven to buy an umbrella (a lovely umbrella, branded "Pierre Balmain — Paris", for 9000KRW), to be able to make it to Hoegi station without melting (because I am such a sweet guy). Since the subway was completely packed, you can imagine the "atmosphere" there, created by wet people and umbrellas. Fortunately, the other train from Wangsimni was less crowded and better ventilated.

Anyhow, there is no point in describing our shopping. I can only say that Marc bought his stuff, while I did not find any nice shoes (except for one Fred Perry sneakers, which were however a little too expensive — I keep them as a last resort backup). The best part of the trip was however the visit to the shooting range. At the Lotte complex at Jamsil station, there is, apart from Lotte World, Lotte Hotel, Lotte Dept. Store, Lotte Cinema and Lotte Mart (damn, there is a whole lotta Lotte!) a small indoor shooting range. Both me and Marc tried the world famous Glock 17, a rather small 9mm semi-automatic gun.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="Glock 17 (source: http://famous-guns.com/glock-17/)"]<img title="Glock 17 (source: http://famous-guns.com/glock-17/)" src="http://www.famous-guns.com/wp-content/uploads/glock-17-03.jpg" alt="Glock 17 9mm handgun" width="400" height="287" />[/caption]
<p style="text-align:left;">We each fired 10 rounds, Marc scored 97, I did only 91, but it was not about the number. The mere feeling of holding the gun is so awesome and frightening at the same time. When you fire, you just need so little force to unleash a force so much bigger and powerful. I definitely want to repeat this some day, preferably more rounds, but I think I don't want to own a gun. Ever.</p>
On a completely different note, we have decided to go to Tokyo after exams, so "YAY!". On top of that, sunny times are supposedly over, since the have already turned on the heating in the dorms. Bye-bye aircon, sundresses and shorts. Hello heaters, coats and long pants.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the basic rules of blogging is: <em>"Never start a post with </em>'I don't know what to write'<em>. If you don't know, then just <strong>don't write anything</strong>!"</em>. Sometimes that's easier said than done. You know, when you get used to blogging about your life and other peculiarities regularly, you miss it when there is nothing interesting going around. For me, blogging became some kind of relax, during which I still do something useful and refresh my mind and brain. Today, I really felt like blogging to take a break from all the pressure and stress about assignments and exams, however, the topic was nowhere to be found. And then it struck me — food! I haven't told you about food here. And because it is quite an extensive topic, let's take it easy and slow.

Since there is no kitchen in the dorms, we are not able to cook for ourselves. That implies, that we have to "eat out" for both lunch and dinner. First choice we have to make is whether to go to the cafeteria or not. The KAIST cafeteria is located at the campus in the Union building, and for 3000KRW offers two kinds of meal (international and Korean) for lunch and one for dinner. They also have breakfast, but that is a typical Korean breakfast (i.e. rice, kimchi, soup, ...), which I am not able to process. The quality of the meals in the cafeteria is very unstable. Some meals, such as chicken curry, hamburger or japanese noodles are very good, but in other cases it is really not my kind of tea. From that reasons, I quite hesitate before I go to the cafeteria, because in most cases I pay for food that I 1) don't like and 2) won't finish. Not a good deal, right...

The second choice is "eating out out". The neighborhood around our campus is quite restaurant-rich, so there is plenty of places to choose from. By now, we have established a bunch of places that we go into, and I will quickly introduce each one of these. Please note that in most cases I don't know the real name of the place, so I will refer to them using our nicknames.
<h1>The regular place</h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Where</strong>: next to Dunkin' Donuts</li>
	<li><strong>What</strong>: Rice + meat, some kind of Korean fast-food</li>
	<li><strong>Price</strong>: Cheap</li>
</ul>
This place was discovered by Marc and it soon became our favorite place to eat. It is just a small room with a counter and a kitchen, where you order your food and get it packed in styrofoam boxes for take away. If you don't want to do take away, they have a room in the basement, where you can eat your meal. Simple, huh?

There are two things that are perfect about this place — it is fast and it is cheap. And it is also good.  Most meals are a combination of some meat (pork, chicken, hamburger patty, tuna) and rice, with kimchi and the yellow reddish as sidedish. Our most favorite combination is 빅치킨마요 and 군만두 (big chicken mayo and kunmandu), which is rice+chicken+egg+kimchi+mayo and Korean dumplings, filled with a mixture of meat and vegetables. All this awesomeness for only 4400KRW (2.7EUR).

Two weeks ago we have realized that we keep going to the same restaurants over and over again, which gets a little stereotypical. Therefore, Marc and I have decided that every Sunday evening, we will go to a new place in the neighborhood to try something different. I will try to keep you updated about our adventures, as well as describe other "regular" places, such as the curry place, the omelete place, the rice place, the chicken steak place, the dumpling guy or the japanese place. Stay tuned for another episode of CULINARY ADVENTURES with 얀!

N.B. Yesterday I found this song by the same guy who did the <a title="Seoul Subway Song (서울 지하철 노래)" href="http://soulexchange.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/seoul-subway-song-%ec%84%9c%ec%9a%b8-%ec%a7%80%ed%95%98%ec%b2%a0-%eb%85%b8%eb%9e%98/">Seoul Subway Song</a> (<a title="Michael Aronson — Time To Rock The World" href="http://www.timetorocktheworld.com/">Michael Aronson</a> aka 마익흘). 김밥 (kimbap) is a Korean dish, that comprises 김 (kim, seaweed) and 밥 (bap, rice). It looks kind of like sushi, and can have many different fillings.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Kimbap (source: http://leseats.com)"]<img title="Kimbap" src="http://leseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/090925kimbap.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />[/caption]

And now the promised song...
