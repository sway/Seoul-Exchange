\textit{``Repent, repent, the end is nigh...''} is a part of the bridge of Bring Me The Horizon's song Chelsea Smile, and even though I took it kind of out of its context (the song continues with \textit{``repent, repent, we're all gonna die''},Â which, I hope, won't happen), it really fits into the context of my exchange and my blog. In two weeks, at this exact moment, I will be sitting in an Airbus A330-200 in Dubai, waiting for take off. I might be slightly drunk, as I will share the first three hours of the 5h stopover with Marc, and I'll be preparing for the last stage of my journey, the flight to Prague. After another 5 hours I will land in Prague, and my S(e)oul eXchange will officially end.

\textit{Hey, hold your horses, man, there is still a long way to go...}

Yeah, right, I still have two weeks full of reports, presentations, and exams. To my great disappointment, two of my exams are in the last week, i.e. on the 19th and 20th. That gives me only two nights for final partying and less than two days for packing, buying souvenirs and giving farewell to all my friends here. I guess I just have to try to enjoy it as much as possible...

And speaking of enjoying, past Monday another mentor-mentee meeting was held by the International Office. Even though some mentors turned up for the first part of the event in the Atrium, eventually the event turned into \textit{``Mentees in the Indy Pub''} event. As my good friend Daniel says, \textit{``Fuck weekend, party on Monday''}, and so we did. Wearing the KAIST hoodies we stormed the \textit{Indy Pub} as a perfectly trained commando. And danced, singed and drank. Lovely evening, I would say.
