Today I found this video (well, someone had posted it on Facebook) and it's so awesome that I have to share it here. I haven't been home for a while, and even though I am not particularly homesick, this really made me look forward to Prague again. I like how it managed to show even the cheesier stuff in a cool way...enjoy!

On a completely different note, I got sick today so my mood is not top top. I hope I will get rid of the cold or whatever soon, so I can truly enjoy the last days here.
