No worries, I am still alive! I was not captured by North Koreans, ran over by a crazy bus driver or mesmerized by Girls Generation (just a little), but there is not that much going on. As the exchange progresses, we are doing less and less exciting stuff, because we have simply exhausted all the options for excitement. Moreover, I still have quite a lot of stuff to do, since I have to work at one assignment for my home uni, arrange things for my graduation, try to find some accommodation in Delft, all this while working on presentations and reports for my current school. So yeah, I am quite busy. On top of that, Christmas are almost here, and I have to figure out the presents and other stuff. Crazy shit!

So just quickly, the most exciting event since the Lantern Festival was our trip to Hansan last weekend. We spent the two days inÂ Hansan-myun, Seocheon-gun, Chungcheongnamdo, and I will publish a post about it later (WIP, y'know). The rest of the week was surprisingly unexciting, since we did not even go out (!!!). Guess we're getting old.

Anyway, it's already December 5th here. That means I have about 17 days before having to pack my suitcase and going to Incheon. I seriously wish it was more\ldots

Btw. now I know it, I am on Team Edward!
