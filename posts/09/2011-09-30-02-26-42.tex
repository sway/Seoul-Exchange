I just realized that in my previous post about the group work here I might have been too European, too mean and self-centered. And that is bad. I greatly admire the respect Koreans show to each other, and I am convinced, that European, or Western culture has a lot to learn from them. We will never be able to be like Koreans, and at the same time, Koreans will never be like us, however, both cultures should try to exchange the positive aspects, because that would bring them closer. Consider this an apology to all my groupmates that might have been offended by my "Westernity" â€” I'll to conform and absorb instead of fighting with the culture.
